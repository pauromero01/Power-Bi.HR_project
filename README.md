# HR Report on general topics

With an imagined human resources dataset, we explore different approaches to analysing the data using Power BI.

## Attrition
Human Resources shows the highest attrition percentage, while Research & Development displays the lowest turnover. Attrition is most common among older employees (50+) and least common in the 30–39 age group. When segmented by salary range, medium-salary employees show the highest attrition count, indicating this group may require deeper analysis regarding retention factors.

## Gender disparities
The company workforce is composed of approximately 60% men and 40% women. Despite this imbalance, overall satisfaction levels remain relatively similar between genders, although men show slightly higher total satisfaction. Monthly income distribution reveals that men collectively earn more, which may be linked to their higher representation or potential differences in job roles.

## Employee satisfaction
Sales Executives and Research Scientists contribute the highest total satisfaction scores, while roles such as Human Resources and Research Directors show comparatively lower satisfaction. By department, R&D generates more than 65% of the total satisfaction, followed by Sales. Satisfaction tends to peak among employees aged 30–40, suggesting this group feels the most engaged and stable.
